# Aurum db
Wrapper around leveldb that makes it possible to read the DB using aurum.js streams. 
Requires Aurum.js and harmonizes well with aurum-server. Makes it possible to open push streams from the database through the webserver all the way into the DOM using the stack of aurum-db aurum-server and aurum.js
AurumDB also offers some higher level abstraction on top of leveldb for ease of use

Highly experimental. Do not use in production
